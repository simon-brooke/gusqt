# Grand Unified Software Quality Tool

Intended to be a wrapper into which many software quality tools can be plugged, and which will produce two separate outputs:

1. an EDN map, integrating all the issues found be any of the tools, which can be parsed by an IDE to provide located notfications;
2. A directory of human-readable, Markdown or HTML, documentation, including not only docstrings culled from the source but also test output, coverage, linter warnings, etc.
